# React Shopping Cart Card using Redux

This is the Task for React Day_12

This React application utilizes Redux for state management in a shopping cart scenario. The `CartCard` component displays product details, allowing quantity adjustments and proceeding to payment. The `UserContextComponent` manages product data via context. Redux handles cart state through `CartSlice`. The main `App` component integrates Redux for state accessibility. The project is organized with distinct files for components, context, Redux slices, and the main application.
